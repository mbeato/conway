## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 8 phases derived from 61 requirements; Phases 3/4/5 can parallelize after Phase 2
- Roadmap: INFRA-06 (Resend domain verification) in Phase 1 to allow DNS propagation before Phase 2 needs email
- 01-01: Used readFileSync instead of Bun.file().textSync() (unavailable in Bun 1.3.10)
- 01-01: PRAGMA table_info introspection for ALTER TABLE guards (not try/catch)
- 01-02: Migration 003 added to make auth_events.user_id nullable for failed login logging
- 01-02: All shared modules accept Database param for testability (no singleton imports)
- 01-02: deductAndRecord uses BEGIN IMMEDIATE for atomic credit operations
- 01-03: Auth rate limiter uses SQLite (not in-memory Map) to survive process restarts
- 01-03: Email module uses fetch() with AbortSignal.timeout(5000) and 1 retry on 5xx
- 01-03: Auth rate limiter inlines its own normalizeEmail to avoid circular dependency with validation.ts
- 02-01: HMAC-SHA256 for verification code hashing (fast for 6-digit codes, secret-keyed)
- 02-01: Fail-open on HIBP API errors to avoid blocking signups
- 02-01: Unverified re-signup deletes old user to prevent stuck accounts
- 02-01: Anti-enumeration on resend-code (generic success for unknown emails)
- 02-02: Pre-computed dummy Argon2id hash at startup for constant-time login
- 02-02: Unverified users get 200 with redirect hint (not 401) for frontend redirect to /verify
- 02-02: Account page CSP allows unsafe-inline for inline logout script (will externalize in 02-03)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~INFRA-06: Resend domain verification requires DNS propagation time~~ RESOLVED 2026-03-16
- Phase 5: Stripe API version string needs verification from Stripe Dashboard at implementation time
- Phase 7: Middleware insertion strategy (router-level vs per-API) needs validation against router.ts
