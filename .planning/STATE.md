# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-15)

**Core value:** Developers and AI agents can access web analysis APIs through a single account with one credit pool, paying with credit card or crypto.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Signup & Login

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 8 (Signup & Login) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (complete)
Status: Phase 2 Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-17 — Completed 02-03 (Auth Pages)

Progress: [██████░░░░] 29%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: 0.38 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 3 | 12min | 4min |
| 02-signup-login | 3 | 13min | 4min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-03 (5min), 02-01 (3min), 02-02 (5min), 02-03 (5min)
- Trend: stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 8 phases derived from 61 requirements; Phases 3/4/5 can parallelize after Phase 2
- Roadmap: INFRA-06 (Resend domain verification) in Phase 1 to allow DNS propagation before Phase 2 needs email
- 01-01: Used readFileSync instead of Bun.file().textSync() (unavailable in Bun 1.3.10)
- 01-01: PRAGMA table_info introspection for ALTER TABLE guards (not try/catch)
- 01-02: Migration 003 added to make auth_events.user_id nullable for failed login logging
- 01-02: All shared modules accept Database param for testability (no singleton imports)
- 01-02: deductAndRecord uses BEGIN IMMEDIATE for atomic credit operations
- 01-03: Auth rate limiter uses SQLite (not in-memory Map) to survive process restarts
- 01-03: Email module uses fetch() with AbortSignal.timeout(5000) and 1 retry on 5xx
- 01-03: Auth rate limiter inlines its own normalizeEmail to avoid circular dependency with validation.ts
- 02-01: HMAC-SHA256 for verification code hashing (fast for 6-digit codes, secret-keyed)
- 02-01: Fail-open on HIBP API errors to avoid blocking signups
- 02-01: Unverified re-signup deletes old user to prevent stuck accounts
- 02-01: Anti-enumeration on resend-code (generic success for unknown emails)
- 02-02: Pre-computed dummy Argon2id hash at startup for constant-time login
- 02-02: Unverified users get 200 with redirect hint (not 401) for frontend redirect to /verify
- 02-02: Account page CSP allows unsafe-inline for inline logout script (will externalize in 02-03)
- 02-03: Auto-login after email verification (session created in /auth/verify, redirect to /account)
- 02-03: Confirm password field on signup with client-side validation
- 02-03: Rate limiter dev-mode bypass (fallback to 127.0.0.1 when no x-real-ip)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~INFRA-06: Resend domain verification requires DNS propagation time~~ RESOLVED 2026-03-16
- Phase 5: Stripe API version string needs verification from Stripe Dashboard at implementation time
- Phase 7: Middleware insertion strategy (router-level vs per-API) needs validation against router.ts
