# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-15)

**Core value:** Developers and AI agents can access web analysis APIs through a single account with one credit pool, paying with credit card or crypto.
**Current focus:** Phase 7 complete, pending verification

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 8 — Phase 7 COMPLETE, pending verification
Plan: 3 of 3 in Phase 7 (all plans complete)
Status: Phase 7 Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-18 — Completed 07-03 (Caddy auth/account/billing routes)

Progress: [███████████████████░] 90%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 14
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: ~0.93 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 3 | 12min | 4min |
| 02-signup-login | 3 | 13min | 4min |
| 03-auth-hardening-sessions | 3 | 16min | 5min |
| 04-api-keys | 2 | 7min | 3.5min |
| 05-stripe-billing | 3 | ~12min | ~4min |
| 07-api-key-auth-middleware | 3 | ~6min | ~2min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 05-02 (~4min), 05-03 (~4min), 07-01 (3min), 07-02 (2min), 07-03 (1min)
- Trend: accelerating

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 8 phases derived from 61 requirements; Phases 3/4/5 can parallelize after Phase 2
- Roadmap: INFRA-06 (Resend domain verification) in Phase 1 to allow DNS propagation before Phase 2 needs email
- 01-01: Used readFileSync instead of Bun.file().textSync() (unavailable in Bun 1.3.10)
- 01-01: PRAGMA table_info introspection for ALTER TABLE guards (not try/catch)
- 01-02: Migration 003 added to make auth_events.user_id nullable for failed login logging
- 01-02: All shared modules accept Database param for testability (no singleton imports)
- 01-02: deductAndRecord uses BEGIN IMMEDIATE for atomic credit operations
- 01-03: Auth rate limiter uses SQLite (not in-memory Map) to survive process restarts
- 01-03: Email module uses fetch() with AbortSignal.timeout(5000) and 1 retry on 5xx
- 01-03: Auth rate limiter inlines its own normalizeEmail to avoid circular dependency with validation.ts
- 02-01: HMAC-SHA256 for verification code hashing (fast for 6-digit codes, secret-keyed)
- 02-01: Fail-open on HIBP API errors to avoid blocking signups
- 02-01: Unverified re-signup deletes old user to prevent stuck accounts
- 02-01: Anti-enumeration on resend-code (generic success for unknown emails)
- 02-02: Pre-computed dummy Argon2id hash at startup for constant-time login
- 02-02: Unverified users get 200 with redirect hint (not 401) for frontend redirect to /verify
- 02-02: Account page CSP allows unsafe-inline for inline logout script (will externalize in 02-03)
- 02-03: Auto-login after email verification (session created in /auth/verify, redirect to /account)
- 02-03: Confirm password field on signup with client-side validation
- 02-03: Rate limiter dev-mode bypass (fallback to 127.0.0.1 when no x-real-ip)
- 03-01: Lockout check runs before verifyPassword result is used but verifyPassword always executes for constant-time
- 03-01: Locked accounts get identical 401 response to wrong-password (anti-enumeration)
- 03-01: Session eviction uses FIFO (oldest first) when exceeding 10 active sessions
- 03-02: Anti-enumeration on forgot-password (always returns success regardless of email existence)
- 03-02: Password reset clears lockout (failed_logins=0, locked_until=NULL) and invalidates ALL sessions
- 03-02: Password change keeps current session, invalidates all other sessions
- 03-02: Two-step forgot-password UX: email entry then code + new password (no auto-submit on code widget)
- 03-03: Settings page uses three stacked sections (no tabs/sidebar) per CONTEXT.md
- 03-03: Full session IDs returned in API (user already has session token in cookie)
- 03-03: Danger Zone logout-all reuses POST /auth/logout then redirects to /login
- 04-01: Label validation: required, max 64 chars, trimmed whitespace (server-side)
- 04-01: DELETE /auth/keys/:id returns 404 for non-existent or already-revoked keys
- 04-02: Copy-to-clipboard uses navigator.clipboard.writeText with textarea fallback
- 04-02: Revoked keys shown inline with reduced opacity and strikethrough (not separate section)
- 04-02: Account page updated with nav links replacing "coming soon" placeholder
- 05-01: No Stripe SDK — all interaction via fetch() with form-encoded bodies
- 05-01: Checkout session metadata includes user_id, tier, credits_amount
- 05-02: Webhook route placed at line 41 (before all middleware) for raw body access
- 05-02: User existence verified before credit granting in webhook
- 05-02: Always returns 200 to Stripe to prevent unnecessary retries
- 05-03: Billing page max-width 720px for 2-column tier grid layout
- 05-03: Balance displayed as dollars (microdollars / 100000)
- 07-01: INTERNAL_AUTH_SECRET generated in x402.ts (not api-key-auth.ts) to avoid circular imports
- 07-01: Null return from apiKeyAuth() signals x402 fallthrough (no breaking changes)
- 07-01: Non-sk_live_ Bearer tokens return null (fall through) to avoid breaking other auth flows
- 07-02: apiKeyAuth() called before subApp.fetch() in catch-all — single insertion point for all 21 APIs
- 07-02: logRequest() userId/apiKeyId params are optional for backward compatibility
- 07-03: No changes to *.apimesh.xyz block needed — Caddy already passes Authorization header

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~INFRA-06: Resend domain verification requires DNS propagation time~~ RESOLVED 2026-03-16
- ~~Phase 5: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET env vars must be configured before testing~~ Code complete, env vars needed for live testing
- Phase 5: Stripe webhook endpoint must be registered in Stripe Dashboard (URL: https://apimesh.xyz/billing/webhook, event: checkout.session.completed)
- ~~Phase 7: Middleware insertion strategy (router-level vs per-API) needs validation against router.ts~~ RESOLVED: Router-level in apis/router.ts catch-all, with x402 bypass via wrapped paymentMiddleware in shared/x402.ts

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-03-18
Stopped at: Phase 7 complete. All 3 plans executed (07-01: Auth middleware + x402 bypass, 07-02: Router integration, 07-03: Caddy config). Pending verification.
