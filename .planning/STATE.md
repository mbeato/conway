# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-07)

**Core value:** Developers and AI agents can access web analysis APIs through a single account with one credit pool, paying with credit card or crypto.
**Current focus:** Phase 14 — demand-driven-scout

## Current Position

Phase: 15
Plan: Not started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- v1.0: 29 plans across 12 phases in 26 days
- v1.1: Not started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 decisions archived in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- [Phase 13]: Auth page body layout changed from centered flex to column flex with margin:auto for footer accommodation
- [Phase 13]: Existing users grandfathered with NULL tos_accepted_at
- [Phase 14]: Env-gated demand API clients return empty results when credentials absent
- [Phase 14]: Static competitor registry maintained manually (no external API dependency)
- [Phase 14]: Measured demand weight 0.25 vs LLM 0.10; daily gpt-4.1 escalation cap of 1 build/day

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Verify gpt-4.1 availability before Phase 15 (pricing page shows gpt-5.4 family — may need alternative)
- DataForSEO requires $50 minimum deposit; Google Autocomplete fallback needed if not funded
- Existing users pre-date any ToS — decide: require re-acceptance on next login or grandfather
