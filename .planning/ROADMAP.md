# Roadmap: APIMesh Stripe Billing & User Accounts

## Overview

This roadmap delivers traditional Stripe billing alongside the existing x402 crypto payment flow. It starts with database foundation and shared modules, builds auth flows, adds Stripe billing and API key management, integrates API key auth across all 21 APIs, and finishes with MCP server support and landing page updates. The dependency chain ensures the existing x402 flow remains untouched until Phase 7, where the branching middleware is carefully inserted.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

  2. Auth module can hash a password with Argon2id and verify it round-trips correctly
  3. Credits module can atomically deduct from a balance and reject when insufficient (unit test passes)
  4. API key module can generate a key, store only its hash, and look it up by hash
  5. Resend domain verification is complete (SPF, DKIM, DMARC records propagated for apimesh.xyz)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Migration runner and database schema

  3. User can change their password from settings (requires current password) and continue their session
  4. User can view active sessions (showing IP, user agent, created date) and revoke any individual session or all sessions
  5. Creating an 11th session auto-revokes the oldest session (max 10 active)

  2. Volume bonuses are applied correctly (0%/10%/20%/30% per tier) and shown before purchase
  3. Credits appear in the user's balance only after webhook confirmation (never on client redirect)
  4. Processing the same Stripe payment_intent twice does not double-grant credits
